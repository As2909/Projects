5,@ChiliM4n,"Beware of OP and Oppo phones guys. My OP7 Pro had a massive burn in after 3 months of light use. You can imagine how it looked like after 4 years. Last year I assumed that they fixed it. Then I went to a store to look at the phones out on display. Literally not a single phone had burn in except for every single Oppo phone. (I didn't find any OP phone on display). The burn in was pretty heavy too. There's something with the screen that they just can't seem to fix and unless they fix that I'll nevery buy an Oppo or OP phone again, especially after hearing how bright this display gets. It's a dealbreaker for me.",2024-02-16T07:36:40Z,0

So with the update we might see new AI user interface implementations like other phones.,2024-02-13T20:23:47Z,0
135,@saine414,"What really matters in a phone this is the best overall with that price. Screen is the best on the market today, with more colors that Samsung 24 and a smoother experience with a brighter screen as well. Battery, holds you forever and charge sooooo much fatser than iPhone and Samsung and you get the charger in the box. Gaming, the best cooling system in a phone and best gaming experience, no frame drop like we seen with Samsung and with all the boosting settings getting any old or new game you want to run ultra smooth. And performance overall is great, with the same chip as the more expensive modells but you get this one cheaper. Camera, it takes good enough pics and vids for the normal person out there but if you really want the best camera go to another phone. But what really matters in a phone this is a done deal and the phone of the year for me and should be officielly as well. If you care about gimic things like AI they will come with a update to make sure you get that as well later on.",2024-02-13T20:21:32Z,0

The rain feature is actually genuinely useful too.

I only keep my phone for a year so tons of years of updates isn't something I massively care about in a phone.

There's a fair amount of AI features, the rain detection stuff is AI for example, the photo editor has the object cutout feature too.

Generally after 2.5 to 3 years my batteries start going downhill fast so I have to replace the phone. I've even tried buying the rare models with replaceable batteries but when I bought a new battery it's been sitting on a shelf so long in some warehouse that it was nearly as bad as the one I was replacing.

Best screen i have seen so far even the edges don't change that. The battery is crazy 16hours screen on time is no problem. 26minutes from 0-100%

Connection is good even at places where i normally have bad signal. 

Performance is typical for the snapdragon 8 gen3. Oxygen os 14 is also a big upgrade to oos13.

The camera is one of the best on the market. There is less after editing on the pictures so they seem less vibrant but very realistic. With pro mode it's perfect for nearly every shot.

Front cam is basic but it's good. Nothing special.

The speakers are nice and the rumbles are the best I've felt so far. Even better then iPhone haptic feedback.

That all and more for less then 800€ is a perfect deal.

One Plus lost their legacy when they sided with Oppo. They can build their brand around OP Open but again, it’s One Plus they will settle at one point. Having used and liked the brand when it was actually the OP we all knew, the experience with the software has gone downhill with Oppo integration. Seriously, you splash all the money on Hasselblad tech and the front camera is that bad?? No serious video or photo improvements. With Hardware, may be a flagship killer, but we are in 2024. Even midrange chips have gotten so good, the software experience is what matters. MKBHD isn’t wrong there; is nth new or remarkable about this phone. Well, interms of hardware same goes for other phones as well. But at least those phones have explored the capabilities  of the Gen 3 chips specially with AI. It’s okay Google and Samsung are working together. Its a win for the users. People are having orgasms with IR blaster and wet screen usage lol. That’s what priorities come down to??? lmao.

The best feature on the S24 Ultra is that it has a flat screen.There's also that nagging feeling that I can't buy a handset that's software linked to China, there's just too much risk of some US/China conflict where these devices could be used to capture data and then weaponise it.

They should learn from Samsung, gaming was a hard part on Samsung now they are clocking highest scores with same chip. The fact that Samsung even surpassed Google with updates and all is commendable!

It was received on January 19th. It is now February 9th and they still haven't contacted me regarding the repair. I have reached out to the company multiple times and they just keep saying someone will get in touch with you. OnePlus is an amazing amazing phone until it isn't.

Nobody is entitled to the amazing, high quality content that you provide FOR FREE, but it would be nice for future reference to maybe use a community post on the main channel, or a short or something, should you decide not to review a product in the future for whatever reason, just so people don't get all conspiratorial.

1440,@leonaldobrum,"I ordered mine yesterday, green, 16GB RAM, 512 GB Storage, and 2 covers... 1K Euros. Now, this year, that Samsung monster with comparable specs and accessories would cost me over 1.4 K€, just like the heavy S23 Ultra that I have and left in the drawer for excessive weight and size to carry. I already have the  OnePlus 11 and it's light, awesome in many ways. So you can see that 4-5 years of OS updates isn't that important for me. 
Which is the phone that you think will still be a joy to carry around with great battery, software stuff AND reliability that could compete with this  OnePlus mastery? I also have and use it!... The iPhone 15 Pro! And NOT that monster, the ProMax - super-expensive, unyielding, another heavy monster ... 
IMO, OnePlus top phones have several things going for them that are superb. They last long (my OnePlus One is still functional! As well are my 3, 5T, 7Pro, 9Pro and 10 Pro - besides my current 11). They all (except the 11, which is good) are weak in the camera department. The 11 got away with a much better camera experience, I'm expecting even better performance from my soon-to-arrive 12.",2024-02-09T12:58:12Z,0

1611,@RocketPunches,"Honestly, your ""no AI"" downside is why I caved and bought this phone last week. To me, that's a massive, massive upside. To the point that for about the same price as the S23 I was thinking about buying, this was a no brainer. Maxed out hardware, no baked in AI bloatware that's going to age like a cracked egg on a summer sidewalk. I have not seen a single AI thing, on any device and especially not on phones, that looked good or seemed genuinely useful to me when compared to its downsides. If I can't trust that the transcription is accurate, it's useless. The image editing stuff, especially the magic eraser and generative fill stuff, looks so smeary and awful that I'm truly surprised you like it because I see it everywhere it's used like a massive beacon smacking me in the face. None of that stuff and a 40% price reduction? Yeah, count me in on that, seems great.

Also, for perspective on the support thing. I'm currently rolling with a Galaxy S8, that's a 7-8 year old phone. It's a bad experience in a lot of apps, its picture quality is, by modern standards, poor, it's battery life is poor (although maybe better than you'd expect), it simply cannot play a lot of games, and generally it has reduced my reliance on my phone in favor of my iPad Air 2 over the last couple years. Most people think it's crazy that I still have an S8 when they find out, and think it's weird. So I think OnePlus is probably right to suggest that number is mostly a marketing exercise and that 7 years of support does not mean 7 years of good user experience.",2024-02-09T11:01:21Z,0

Four years later, I gave the Oneplus 11 a chance, after seeing mostly positive reviews. I am disappointed as hell with this phone. The scrolling stutter is worse than ever, 120 Hz in all apps is only possible with a third party app that isn't even listed in the Play Store (at least this seems to be fixed now), and the clock on the always on display can not be disabled without disabling the always on display entirely, which just wastes battery life. Oneplus seems to ignore these issues despite being well aware of them. I will never buy a Oneplus phone again and wouldn't recommend them to anyone. The best hardware is useless, if the software is not up to par. Next time I will get a Pixel, a Samsung or an iPhone.",2024-02-09T09:12:30Z,0

I like the AI features, but they're by no means a must. For the price, the OP12 is a score. I also think that the cameras are stronger than he describes, the photos are great.

Switched from Note20 Ultra 5G.
The 12 is extremely good for the price. Only the iqoo pro or the red magic pro beats this in benchmark if that's your thing. S24 actually have a lower score in stress test or the long run. They have heat problems as the 12 uses some duo Cryo chamber that covers almost your whole phone to cool it without fans like those 2 I've mentioned. And they don't have 50w wireless charging and inferior cameras. This is the most bang for your buck you could get as a true flagship killer for $599 AND free upgrade to 512G. Helluva deal with specs.that will at least last you 4yrs of top hard & software support for $599 can't go wrong. Like my old Note20 Ultra 5G does everything a flagship today does. We still at 5G, vrr 120hz, 4k, HDR10+, bt s-pen, 8k vid, wifi 6, UWB, MST, 100x zoom, ultrasonic under display fingerprint sensor, Bluetooth 5.x..etc. you get the point.. still does it all.

Inlude a headphone jack and a micro SD card slot keep the screen size under 6.3"" and they most probably sell good. And don't dare remove the alert slider.

So if a Phone cost $650USD , by the phone hits Australia it is at a price of $1,000 AUD. Then a 10% Goods and services charge added on $1,100 AUD. Then sales tax as well and then the Authorised dealer's have to take their cut. So we are paying like $1700 AUD and up for these phones. Example my SE2020 the $399 USD one cost me $829 AUD. All we ask of APPLE is to make them work .No overheating, no bendgate no drop out's no glitches, have SIRI Fit for Purpose (not useless) , be able to upgrade past IOS 17.0 (which my iPhone SE2020 refuses to do. ) Why can't the american's make something that works, instead of producing JUNK.? The trend now that we are in an inflationary environment is to Forget about the APPLE JUNK and buy the mid range ones or even the base models which do 95% of the Flagship things? That's why I will be reverting back to Android .Other than that , good synopsis on the Oneplus 12 phone , even though we don't stock it /them in Australia.",2024-02-09T07:04:20Z,1

Their reasoning is that after this period, the user experience might decline due to aging hardware. Personally, I find this explanation a bit lacking—it sounds like an excuse.

As a Note 20 Ultra user, I would continue using my device if it weren’t for the impending expiration of security patches next year and the enticing Samsung trade-in offers. I still own several flagship phones, and I’m confident that they could perform well with a newer operating system. The hardware in these devices is robust, and I believe they could remain functional for years with regular updates.

In a way, it reminds me of the PC cycle from the past. If smartphones follow a similar pattern, we might see longer lifespans for these devices, especially since recent hardware advancements haven’t been as dramatic as they were a decade ago.",2024-02-09T06:54:58Z,0

It may just be as simple as they don't believe the phone will last much longer than that or that the average 1st user ownership of their phones is about that.,2024-02-09T06:18:02Z,0

Do you think that you could pick up a pixel 2 right now and it would feel like a good experience. Also at 7 years what features are you going to be missing after all the updates. Like google does not even give the same features to the 8 as the 8pro let alone a 5 or 6 or 7 year old phone. I think 4 years is a pretty good sweet spot for updates.

It has little annoyances that stack up:

• The media player requires extra clicks to get to the scrubbing bar (when pulling down)
• The notifications have weird quirks. Marques talked about these last year. Clicking a collapsed stack of notifications doesn't open the app but just expands the stack.
• Gestures with 3rd party launchers have a terrible, long pause when swiping up to go home.",2024-02-09T05:41:31Z,6

2404,@doodbro931,"The things OnePlus downgraded with this is the curved screen and the selfie camera placement. Curved screens are very annoying to use with a case and is annoying to use because of accidental inputs. And the selfie camera in the middle, is very annoying if you use YouTube or any other app in landscape for more than a few minutes. It was much better in the corner, doesn't get in the way, and keeps the screen overall cleaner. Plus the top corners are mostly useless  aside from notifications and battery icons.",2024-02-09T05:20:47Z,0

Even all the way back to a Galaxy S9 will get you $1000 trade-in credit on T-Mobile. With OnePlus 12, that's only going to get you $130 credit. So the OnePlus 12 ends up being a lot more expensive than the Galaxy S24 Ultra when all is said and done.

If you're looking for a flagship killer then you should really look at the OnePlus 12R. As far as OnePlus is concerned, gone are the days of terms such as Pro, Plus and Ultra. I find the new simplistic way their classifying their devices to be a great idea. 
Strictly speaking, I've never really found a problem with their cameras since their involvement with hasselblad. The big problem with many people is that they're used to the point and shoot of an iphone. The same people pick up a OnePlus device with a hasselblad and they don't know how to use the camera application. It takes time to learn and once you do the photos are amazing.

2657,@logicalparadox2897,"If this phone was IP68, i would be all in. But no. For some reason they can't just release a pro version with IP68 and a few other small upgrades to make it more premium?

I guess I'm still stuck on my 9 Pro. I don't get why the whole ""OnePlus is back"" narrative it's completely centered on price. I don't want a flagship killer, I just want a flagship that isn't Samsung or Apple. For software reasons. And the pixel has never appealed to me sadly.

The fast charging, rate screen, great battery life. I'm here for it. But what's saving a couple hundred bucks over the course of a couple of years if I have to worry that one day I'm going to drop my phone into the bathtub or the sink or a puddle. The peace of mind factor is huge. It's not just about the cost of a dead phone, because you can get insurance for that. It's about now your phone is dead. Wherever you are whatever you were doing you no longer have a phone until you can put in a claim and get a new one sent out. That's a real bummer at your pool party or your fun day at the beach. And it makes that stressful evening where you're rushing to get the dishes done because you got home from work late into A much worse experience when your phone slips out of your wet hands and disappears under the suds and comes back up lifeless.",2024-02-09T04:22:10Z,0

Faster processor

When iPhones get new color we get new video on your channel knowing the fact there is nothing new just the color but when other companies like Oneplus or samsung does something we have to wait alot of time for a video to come out or sometimes it doesn't even come out or isn't that detailed as apple products. Its also the case with Samsung tabs and apple tabs. Apple product videos are very detailed but others are not. Hope you can do it😊",2024-02-09T04:04:50Z,9
