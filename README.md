### SQL - Data Cleaning
#### Project overview
This SQL script performs data cleaning operations on the Nashville Housing dataset. The dataset contains information about housing properties in Nashville, including sale dates, property addresses, and owner addresses. The script standardizes the date format, populates missing property addresses, breaks out addresses into individual columns (address, city, state), converts 'Y' and 'N' values to 'Yes' and 'No' in the 'SoldAsVacant' field, removes duplicate records, and deletes unused columns. \
