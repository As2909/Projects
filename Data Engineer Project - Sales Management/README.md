## Data Transformation Pipeline for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2

### Overview
This project aims to create a comprehensive data transformation pipeline for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. The pipeline will handle data ingestion, processing, transformation, and storage using Apache Spark and Azure Databricks. Key components include:

- **Data Ingestion:** Raw data from various sources will be ingested into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (`ingested-data` container).
- **Data Transformation:** Using Spark DataFrame operations, the data will be standardized, cleaned, and enriched before being stored in the `transformation-1` container.
- **Data Normalization:** Column names in the transformed data will be normalized to ensure consistency.
- **Data Loading:** Transformed data will be loaded into the `transformation-2` container in Delta format.
- **Data Access:** Views will be created in Azure Synapse Analytics for querying the transformed data.

### Technologies Used
- Apache Spark
- Azure Databricks
- Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
- Azure Synapse Analytics

### Objectives
- Ingest raw data into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
- Process and transform raw data into a standardized format.
- Normalize column names in the transformed data.
- Load transformed data into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 in Delta format.
- Create views in Azure Synapse Analytics for querying transformed data.

### Benefits
- Improved data quality and consistency.
- Enhanced data accessibility and query performance.
- Scalable and efficient data processing.

### Future Scope
- Implement data validation and quality checks.
- Integrate real-time data processing.
- Enhance data visualization and reporting capabilities.

### Conclusion
This project provides a robust data transformation pipeline for Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, enabling organizations to derive valuable insights from high-quality, standardized data.
