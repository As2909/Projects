# SALES OVERVIEW 
### Project overview
* This project explores different business metrics and how they can be displayed graphically.
* I explore the relation between sales, costumers and products
* We can obtain conclusions that will help us to make better marketing campaigns and improve profits
* The tools used are MsSQL server and Power-BI 

### Objectives:
The goal is to build a sales report that shows summarized information about the businessÂ´s current situation to understand how to make more profits. 

The most important indicators are sales, budget, top products & worst products.

### Conclusions
* The best customers are Jordan Turner, Maurice Shan, Janet Munoz, and Lisa Cai
* The best product is the Mountain-200 Black but all color sell well
* During July, September, and November 2020 our sales were less than Budget. I need more information to understand why
